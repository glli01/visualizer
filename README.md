# Visualizer
This project is based on Clement Mihailescu's visualizer, but seeks to expand upon the features he previewed.

Everything will be done in order to learn and expand upon my knowledge of react, with the original code revamped (into functional components instead of using a class component) and explained through comments.

After the original code, additional algorithms and a ui will be added to demonstrate mastery.
